// These are the important learning that  i have made through mistakes
// 1. Whenever you are using Disjoint set union try to call the parent for each element once so that the actual parent of each node get set perfectly.
// 2. In case of fenwick try always using 1 indexed array with it as it can create problem in case of zero
// 3. In game theory question try to look at the problem in the form of a tree which is similiar to the three max min tree  which we have seen in AIES course work.
// 4. While attempting oa or contest on leet code try to use your own min and max function as they are only capable of dealing with integers not with long long
