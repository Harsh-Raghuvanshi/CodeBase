// These are the important learning that  i have made through mistakes
// 1. Whenever you are using Disjoint set union try to call the parent for each element once so that the actual parent of each node get set perfectly.
// 2. In case of fenwick try always using 1 indexed array with it as it can create problem in case of zero
// 3. In game theory question try to look at the problem in the form of a tree which is similiar to the three max min tree  which we have seen in AIES course work.
// 4. While attempting oa or contest on leet code try to use your own min and max function as they are only capable of dealing with integers not with long long
// 5. So whenver you declare a global variable let say count and try to use it in other functions then you will encounter an error like count is ambigious the main reason for that is under the namespace standard count is also present as function in header file which is causing ambiguity to resolve this issue do not use names which can be present in header files
